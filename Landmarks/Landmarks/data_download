############ DATA DOWNLOADING ############

This option downloads the data specified in the given CSV file. It is recommended to use this option for preapration of the data sets, because it also creates specific directory structure, which is required for other options of the program to work.

TRAIN FILE FORMAT

The file should be in the CSV format. The name isn't fixed - it is possible to pick whatever. It should contain the header (or at least one free row), the main data should start in the second row.
Each row of the file should contain:

    - ID: id of the photo. It should be unique at least in the range of the single class. It is used as a aprt of the name of the downloaded image file.
    - URL: the url of the image. It should give direct access to the image, not to the website, which contains it.
    - LANDMARK ID: the id of the landmark, it can (and in fact should) be considered as the id of the class of the training images.
    
All of the above attributes should be placed in single line for each photo and separated with a comma without spaces - depending on the regional options, it is sometimes considered as placing data in separate cells, sometimes not (the program doesn't accept semicolons as separators).
Any of the presented above features should not be blank (eg. such line is unacceptable: 2n234bwqjknr21,,6512)

TEST FILE FORMAT

Similar to train file, the test file should be a CSV file named in any way.
