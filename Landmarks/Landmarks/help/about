############ ABOUT ############

"Landmarks" is a project prepared for the Biologically Inspired Artificial Intelligence subject, conducted in Silesian University of Technology, Faculty of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science.
The aim of the project is to prepare a program, which will be able to recognize specific architectonic landmarks in the given photos, using artificial neural network.
The program has a text interface, all commands are send by typing specific numbers or letters and confirming the choice with Enter. The program gives following options:

    1 - downloading data
    2 - train.
    3 - test.
    4 - about&help
    5 - exit

PYTHON VERSION & LIBRARIES

The project requires Python 3 (originally it was written in Python 3.6.5).

All of the given versions are those, which were used during creating the project, it is possible for the project to work with lower versions, but not guaranted.

To run the project, there should be installed following libraries (all of them are possible to install via pip):

    - TensorFlow, version 1.8.0 (it is highly recommended to use GPU version of the library)
    - Keras, version 2.1.6
    - matplotlib, version 2.2.2
    - pillow (PIL), version 5.1.0
    - numpy, version 1.14.2

Additionally, it is recomended to use following libraries (both of them are used to plot the architecture of the network in the form of the *.jpg file, so it isn't mandatory to install them):

    - pydot, version 1.2.4 (possible to install via pip)
    - Graphviz, version 2.38 (should be installed separately, the installators can be found here: https://www.graphviz.org/download/)
